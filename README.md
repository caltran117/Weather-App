# <Weather-App>

## Description

I wanted to build this app to be able to test my skills of building a weather application and using API to link my front end to the back end server. This will provide me with necessary skills to use api for other creative projects.
This application solves the problem of searching for the weather but provides a easy to use application that allows you to get a quick 5 day forecast for any location
I was able to learn to use api coding to link to my DOM.
